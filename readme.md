The website at [https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ericoc/moss/](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ericoc/moss/)
hosts microscopic images taken of moss using
the [_Quanta 600 FEG Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM)_](https://www.nano.upenn.edu/equipment/quanta-600-feg-esem/).

The moss was collected from northern _Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA_
on Tues. May 20, 2025. On Wed. May 21, the moss was briefly frozen in
liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) before being left to outgas under vacuum
for an hour or two, in order to ensure that it was dry.
